== About ==

MintyDocs is a MediaWiki extension that lets you store well-
structured documentation within the wiki by grouping pages into
products, product versions, manuals and individual topic pages.
Its structure is based on that of the PonyDocs extension, although
it has a simpler approach to defining the structure.

For more information on the MintyDocs extension, see its homepage at:

== Credits ==

The MintyDocs extension was created by Yaron Koren. Its overall
concept of four page types is based on the PonyDocs extension.
